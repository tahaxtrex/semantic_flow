    description: >
      Does the text concentrate on explaining core concepts relevant to its
      stated objective, or does it include unnecessary digressions and fluff?

  - id: example_concreteness

  - id: example_coherence
    name: "Example Coherence"
    description: >
      Are examples consistent and thematically connected across sections?

      low: "1-3: Examples contradict each other or are thematically scattered"
      mid: "4-6: Some thematic connection but inconsistencies exist"

  - id: business_relevance
    name: "Business Relevance"
    description: >
      Does the content directly address identified performance gaps?

  - id: instructional_alignment
    name: "Instructional Alignment"
    description: >
      Are instructional materials current, accurate, and professionally presented?
